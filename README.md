# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Webpage

## Description

This webpage is designed to be visually and functionally identical to the initial code supplied but with greatly improved accessibility by changing element tags to semantic tags and reducing clutter and removed redundancies. Detailed changes are as follows:

### HTML

- Changed div elements to main, section, nav, or article.
- Changed background image to a figure, added aria-label in case image fails to load.
- Fixed linkage bug at line 18 by changing line 36 as it was tagged with a class attribute rather than an id .
- Renumbered headers so that they would sequentially increase as we go down the page.

### CSS

- Consolidated many of the rules that were repeated. Some rules added to the universal selector as part of the consolidation.
- Renamed several rules that were overly specific to improve accessibility.
- Reorganized the list of rules so that structure, heading, text, and image rules were grouped for easier readability
